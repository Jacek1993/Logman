Logman is an **ASP.NET** application which receives application logs through some REST APIs, and then lets the end users see and analyse them through lists and chart.

> This project is a work-in-progress. It's 80% done and will be ready for use with some improvements.

** Roadmap: **

What is needed to complete this project is:

- Complete the UI code
- Add unit tests
- Use some dependencies by using IOC (e.g. in SQLServer DataAccess Layer class)
- Fix namings. Some namings are not correct (e.g. the SQL Server data access layer is in a folder called Facade!)
- Add NLog target
